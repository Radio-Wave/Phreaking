  <h2>Press Release</h2>

  <!-- 1. Intro quote -->
  <blockquote class="intro-quote">
    “We fear forgetting, losing memories, and want to store and archive everything, throwing nothing away. 
    Do we have the courage to forget?”

    <p>
      The Phreaking Collective invites you to <strong>Bit Rot</strong>, a group exhibition that explores the fragility, decay, 
      and obsolescence of our digital age. Taking its name from the slow degradation of digital files over time, 
      Bit Rot stages a post-human reflection on the technologies that once promised progress and the lives they now leave behind.
    </p>

    <p>
      Visitors are invited into a world where bots are trained on the voices of forgotten users and inactive profiles, 
      where decaying systems generate new poetics, and where digital forgetting becomes an act of care. 
      Curated by a collective of computational artists born into the internet age, Bit Rot is both a mourning space and a speculative future archive.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alongside the exhibition, the Phreaking Collective will host a weekend of free public programming, 
      including hands-on workshops, artist talks, live performances, and community events. 
      This will open access to new forms of digital literacy, storytelling, and cultural memory.

           a 3D and experimental digital media artist. Tampering with both dated and out-of-favour,
           and modern emerging technologies, his medium is found in the coalescence of the aesthetics of software and

          explores relationships between fauna, flora and machines by investigating movement, land and
          digital culture through emerging technologies, interactive installations, and data visualisation. His work
          explores human-machine collaborations, shifting between macro and micro perspectives, both stepping back
          to observe broader geopolitical systems and zooming in to reveal the microscopic worlds of ecology and
          materiality. <br>

        <p>
           Hauntology, anachronistic technology, digital psychogeography and a fantasy of escape shape
          the atmosphere of my practice. I work to reveal the quiet strangeness embedded in everyday spaces and the
          emotional weight of ordinary objects, moments and landscapes. Storytelling is fundamental to my practice,
          providing a framework through which I can explore the layers of personal and collective experience, revealing
          the unseen connections between the past and present.

        <p>
           aims to humorize lived experiences by telling stories that infiltrate realms uniquely human with
          elements uniquely digital. Inspired by cultural byproducts of our interactions with designed objects and
          concerned with the overwhelming amount of waste created by man’s industrial exploits, much of his work aims
          to comment on the politics of ownership, obsession, sprawl, and scale.

        <h3>Phoenix Isla Kea </h3>
        <p>
          Phoenix Isla Kea (b. 2003) is a London-born Polynesian artist working with computation, sound, and installation. With a background in photography and film, her current practice explores the psychological and emotional textures of online life, particularly the aesthetics of seduction, digital exploitation, and algorithmic control.
          Blending technical systems with embodied inquiry -  Kea builds web environments, manipulates found media, and composes machinic forms shaped as much by emotional intensity - rage, longing, obsession, as by logic.
          Her research interrogates girlhood as a tactical identity, and the feedback loops between visibility, desire, and control in algorithmic culture.

        <h3>Nikos Antonio Kourous Vázquez</h3>
        <p>
        My work stems from a desire to challenge and expand prevailing narratives around machine learning: what it is, how it functions, and how it might evolve. As ‘machine learning’ becomes the mythologized term ‘artificial intelligence,’ as user-machine relationships become engraved, and as companies scramble to innovate and incorporate it, I feel compelled to create space for the technology to define itself.

        <h3>Louise Wan</h3>
        <p>
          creates kinetic sculptures and mechanical installations that perform futile, looping gestures. Rooted in absurdity, her machines blur the boundaries between bodies and automation, agency and exhaustion. Her work reflects on broken systems, digital remnants, and the poetics of malfunction—questioning what persists, what decays, and what is keeping in motion.

  <h3>Zepu Li</h3>
  <p>   
    Zepu Li is a Chinese artist based in London. His work explores the subtle tensions between natural forces—such as wind, water, and stone—and urban structures like scaffolding and screws. He focuses on the “whispering gaps” that emerge between these materials: spaces where light drifts, gravity pauses, and time softens. Rooted in dérive, his process involves drifting through cities, collecting fragments—plants, debris, forgotten parts—and reassembling them into skeletal, shifting installations. Using materials like enamel, rice paper, and silk thread, Li creates works that respond to light, wind, and weight. In a fast-paced and dense reality, his practice unfolds through slowness and wandering as ongoing acts of perception and construction.

        <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
        <p>
The Phreaking Collective is a London-based group of emerging computational artists working across code, sculpture, sound, installation, and digital media. Formed in 2025, the collective takes its name from phreaking, a term initially used to describe the subversive practice of hacking telephone systems in the 1960s and 70s. Drawing from this lineage of creative mischief and network disruption, the Phreaking Collective reclaims the term as a gesture toward experimentation, resistance, and intimacy within digital systems.
