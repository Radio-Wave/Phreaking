    <h2>Press Release</h2>

    <!-- 1. Intro quote -->
    <blockquote class="intro-quote">
      “We fear forgetting, losing memories, and want to store and archive everything, throwing nothing away.
      Do we have the courage to forget?”
      <footer>

      <p>
        The Phreaking Collective invites you to <strong>Bit Rot</strong>, a group exhibition that explores the
        fragility, decay,
        and obsolescence of our digital age. Taking its name from the slow degradation of digital files over time,
        Bit Rot stages a post-human reflection on the technologies that once promised progress and the lives they now
        leave behind.
      </p>

      <p>
        Visitors are invited into a world where bots are trained on the voices of forgotten users and inactive profiles,
        where decaying systems generate new poetics, and where digital forgetting becomes an act of care.
        Curated by a collective of computational artists born into the internet age, Bit Rot is both a mourning space
        and a speculative future archive.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alongside the exhibition, the Phreaking Collective will host a weekend of free public programming,
        including hands-on workshops, artist talks, live performances, and community events.
        This will open access to new forms of digital literacy, storytelling, and cultural memory.

    <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
    <p>
      The Phreaking Collective is a London-based group of emerging computational artists working across code, sculpture,
      sound, installation, and digital media. Formed in 2025, the collective takes its name from phreaking, a term
      initially used to describe the subversive practice of hacking telephone systems in the 1960s and 70s. Drawing from
      this lineage of creative mischief and network disruption, the Phreaking Collective reclaims the term as a gesture
      toward experimentation, resistance, and intimacy within digital systems.

        <h3>Jack Jessé</h3>
        <p>
          explores relationships between fauna, flora and machines by investigating movement, land and
          digital culture through emerging technologies, interactive installations, and data visualisation. His work
          explores human-machine collaborations, shifting between macro and micro perspectives, both stepping back
          to observe broader geopolitical systems and zooming in to reveal the microscopic worlds of ecology and
          materiality. <br>

          Hauntology, anachronistic technology, digital psychogeography and a fantasy of escape shape
          the atmosphere of my practice. I work to reveal the quiet strangeness embedded in everyday spaces and the
          emotional weight of ordinary objects, moments and landscapes. Storytelling is fundamental to my practice,
          providing a framework through which I can explore the layers of personal and collective experience, revealing
          the unseen connections between the past and present.

        <h3>Phoenix Isla Kea </h3>
        <p>
          Phoenix Isla Kea (b. 2003) is a London-born Polynesian artist working with computation, sound, and
          installation. With a background in photography and film, her current practice explores the psychological and
          emotional textures of online life, particularly the aesthetics of seduction, digital exploitation, and
          algorithmic control.
          Blending technical systems with embodied inquiry - Kea builds web environments, manipulates found media, and
          composes machinic forms shaped as much by emotional intensity - rage, longing, obsession, as by logic.
          Her research interrogates girlhood as a tactical identity, and the feedback loops between visibility, desire,
          and control in algorithmic culture.

        <h3>Nikos Antonio Kourous Vázquez</h3>
        <p>
          My work stems from a desire to challenge and expand prevailing narratives around machine learning: what it is,
          how it functions, and how it might evolve. As ‘machine learning' becomes the mythologized term ‘artificial
          intelligence,' as user-machine relationships become engraved, and as companies scramble to innovate and
          incorporate it, I feel compelled to create space for the technology to define itself.

        <h3>Louise Wan</h3>
        <p>
          creates kinetic sculptures and mechanical installations that perform futile, looping gestures. Rooted in
          absurdity, her machines blur the boundaries between bodies and automation, agency and exhaustion. Her work
          reflects on broken systems, digital remnants, and the poetics of malfunction—questioning what persists, what
          decays, and what is keeping in motion.

        <h3>Zepu Li</h3>
        <p>
          Zepu Li is a Chinese artist based in London. His work explores the subtle tensions between natural forces—such
          as wind, water, and stone—and urban structures like scaffolding and screws. He focuses on the “whispering
          gaps” that emerge between these materials: spaces where light drifts, gravity pauses, and time softens. Rooted
          in dérive, his process involves drifting through cities, collecting fragments—plants, debris, forgotten
          parts—and reassembling them into skeletal, shifting installations. Using materials like enamel, rice paper,
          and silk thread, Li creates works that respond to light, wind, and weight. In a fast-paced and dense reality,
          his practice unfolds through slowness and wandering as ongoing acts of perception and construction.

          working with scrap and found materials repurposing them to form new identities and narratives differing from
          their original purpose or intention. The texture of materials is important to her practice, exploring how it
          evokes memory and time. More recently she has become interested in screen based installation work exploring

          navigating dual cultural landscapes. With a background in architecture from the Architectural Association and
          a Master's in Design for Performance and Interaction from The Bartlett, UCL, Jin approaches art-making through
          a multidisciplinary lens that merges spatial thinking with interactive technologies.
          Her work is characterized by immersive, sensory-driven experiences that invite reflection on personal and
          collective identity. By integrating sound, space, and digital environments, Jin constructs evocative
          installations that engage both emotionally and conceptually. She has exhibited internationally, including at
          the London Festival of Architecture, Ars Electronica in Linz, and KIKK Festival in Belgium </p>
