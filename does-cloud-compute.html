            The Phreaking Collective invites you to <em>Does Cloud Compute (ever) Precipitate?</em> - An exhibition that
            asks a question and tells a poem. If clouds in nature condense and return as rain, can the digital cloud
            ever give back what it takes? Can data come home to the people who made it?

  <section class="body-copy">
          <p>
            This show explores the hidden infrastructures that shape our lives, bringing materiality to the ethereal. It
            explores our relationship with the monoliths that are waking up, the environmental strain, the invisible
            human labour, and the worries of pooled resources in an unreturning atmosphere. Working across
            installations, sound works, generative systems and computational artwork, the exhibition examines the quiet
            romance in technological convenience.</p>

          <p>The Cloud, an unseen network of servers, energy and labour - is made tangible, visible and audible.The
            works confront the vast systems that silently maintain our lives, datacenters that feed on our energy and
            attention and the dependent relationship we have, the systems behind each upload, generation and stream.
          </p>

          <p> Running alongside the two week show is a series of talks, workshops, discussions, film screenings and
            performances where visitors are invited to look deeper into the unsung systems shaping our lives, and
            reflect on the strange romance and hidden dependencies that define our connection to the cloud.

        <p>
          explores relationships between fauna, flora and machines by investigating movement, land and
          digital culture through emerging technologies, interactive installations, and data visualisation. His work
          explores human-machine collaborations, shifting between macro and micro perspectives, both stepping back
          to observe broader geopolitical systems and zooming in to reveal the microscopic worlds of ecology and
          materiality. <br>

        <h3>Phoenix Isla Kea </h3>
        <p>
          Phoenix Isla Kea (b. 2003) is a London-born Polynesian artist working with computation, sound, and
          installation. With a background in photography and film, her current practice explores the psychological and
          emotional textures of online life, particularly the aesthetics of seduction, digital exploitation, and
          algorithmic control.
          Blending technical systems with embodied inquiry - Kea builds web environments, manipulates found media, and
          composes machinic forms shaped as much by emotional intensity - rage, longing, obsession, as by logic.
          Her research interrogates girlhood as a tactical identity, and the feedback loops between visibility, desire,
          and control in algorithmic culture.

        <h3>Nikos Antonio Kourous Vázquez</h3>
        <p>
          My work stems from a desire to challenge and expand prevailing narratives around machine learning: what it is,
          how it functions, and how it might evolve. As ‘machine learning' becomes the mythologized term ‘artificial
          intelligence,' as user-machine relationships become engraved, and as companies scramble to innovate and
          incorporate it, I feel compelled to create space for the technology to define itself.

        <h3>David Lazãr</h3>
        <p>
          My practice emerges from the intersection of software engineering and
artistic research. I explore technological systems not as innovative tools
but as powerful infrastructures that shape human identity, behavior, and
our public space. By translating this critical inquiry into installations
and code-based works, I reveal how technology restructures our human
experience and reconstructs our ethical perception.
