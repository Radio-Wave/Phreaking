            The Phreaking Collective invited visitors to <em>Does Cloud Compute (ever) Precipitate?</em> - An exhibition that
            asks a question and tells a poem. If clouds in nature condense and return as rain, can the digital cloud
            ever give back what it takes? Can data come home to the people who made it?

            <p>
              This show explores the hidden infrastructures that shape our lives, bringing materiality to the ethereal.
              It
              explores our relationship with the monoliths that are waking up, the environmental strain, the invisible
              human labour, and the worries of pooled resources in an unreturning atmosphere. Working across
              installations, sound works, generative systems and computational artwork, the exhibition examines the
              quiet
              romance in technological convenience.</p>

            <p>The Cloud, an unseen network of servers, energy and labour - is made tangible, visible and audible.The
              works confront the vast systems that silently maintain our lives, datacenters that feed on our energy and
              attention and the dependent relationship we have, the systems behind each upload, generation and stream.
            </p>

            <p> Running alongside the two week show was a series of talks, workshops, discussions, film screenings and
              performances where visitors were invited to look deeper into the unsung systems shaping our lives, and
              reflect on the strange romance and hidden dependencies that define our connection to the cloud.

              <p>
                A Chengdu-born, London-based computational artist whose practice spans interactive installations,
                web-based experiments and immersive 3D environments. She examines how images, code, and audience
                interaction shape our sense of identity, memory and place. At the heart of Li’s work is the translation
                of
                the intangible experiences, making the unseen visible.

              <h3>Xach Hill</h3>
              <p>
                Xach Hill is British-Kiwi transmedia artist, curator and creative technologist working across sculpture,
                code, and poetry. He explores the entanglement of human memory and machine logic, often using AI, LED
                matrices, and hacked hardware to question what it means to be seen, remembered, or misinterpreted by a
                system. Rooted in both computational poetics and glitch aesthetics, his work invites audiences into
                spaces
                where identity, intimacy, and error co-exist.

              <h3>Nikos Antonio Kourous Vázquez</h3>
              <p>
                My work stems from a desire to challenge and expand prevailing narratives around machine learning: what
                it
                is,
                how it functions, and how it might evolve. As ‘machine learning' becomes the mythologized term
                ‘artificial
                intelligence,' as user-machine relationships become engraved, and as companies scramble to innovate and
                incorporate it, I feel compelled to create space for the technology to define itself.

                explores relationships between fauna, flora and machines by investigating movement, land and
                digital culture through emerging technologies, interactive installations, and data visualisation. His
                work
                explores human-machine collaborations, shifting between macro and micro perspectives, both stepping back
                to observe broader geopolitical systems and zooming in to reveal the microscopic worlds of ecology and
                materiality. <br>

              <p>
                Robin Leverton (b. 1995, UK) is a Croydon-based artist, curator, technologist, and researcher. His work
                explores the materiality and ontology of artificial intelligence, particularly in relation to identity,
                embodiment, and agency. His practice spans sculpture, painting, printmaking, and installation,
                integrating cutting edge technologies into traditional arts practices. </p>

              <p>
                Phoenix Isla Kea (b. 2003) is a London-born Polynesian artist working with computation, sound, and
                installation. With a background in photography and film, her current practice explores the psychological
                and
                emotional textures of online life, particularly the aesthetics of seduction, digital exploitation, and
                algorithmic control.
                Blending technical systems with embodied inquiry - Kea builds web environments, manipulates found media,
                and
                composes machinic forms shaped as much by emotional intensity - rage, longing, obsession, as by logic.
                Her research interrogates girlhood as a tactical identity, and the feedback loops between visibility,
                desire,
                and control in algorithmic culture.

              <h3>Jasmine Broadhurst</h3>
              <p>
                Jasmine Broadhurst is an interdisciplinary artist working across computational and physical systems and
                material processes. Her practice explores tension between lived human experience and technological
                structures.

                She graduated from Central Saint Martins with a degree in Fashion Design Knitwear. This education
                grounded her practice in material sensitivity, embodied making, and an understanding of machines as
                physical collaborators. She is drawn to systems and processes that operate imperfectly, where technology
                functions as a creative collaborator: transforming cold infrastructure into a means of questioning and
                reflection. Moments of friction are central to her practice, embracing uncertainty and tension as
                integral components of meaning.

              <p>
                My practice operates at the intersection of software engineering and artistic research, examining
                technology not as a neutral tool but as an infrastructure that shapes identity, behavior, and public
                space. Through installations, web-based works, and AI-driven experiments, I expose systems of
                automation, surveillance, and data extraction, translating invisible mechanisms into embodied
                experiences. Grounded in research, my process visualizes technological power structures and their
                ethical consequences. Shaped by my background in tech, I work with small-scale, sustainable computing
                informed by permacomputing principles, emphasizing transparency, care, and ecological responsibility. My
                work invites critical reflection on progress, efficiency, and the futures we imagine for technology.

              <p>
                My name is Dylan Morris, I am a 27 year-old mixed media visual artist working out of South-East London.
                I use mostly found materials that have their own narrative in a wider cultural context and manipulate
                them to communicate something personal, attempting to create a harmony between the communal experience
                and my own. I'm interested in reflecting on the experience of growing up in an increasingly complex
                digital environment. I try to examine the contested terrain of contemporary media culture, understand
                the forces at play and eventually subvert the forces of commercialist cultural control. </p>

            Why are file formats? are they real? what???
            This workshop explored what file formats really are, where they came from, and why they make us suffer.
            It started with an intro to Permacomputing, and how speculative art projects could save
            engineering!
            Then, participants learned just enough computer science to be dangerous.
            With these new skills, they explored the surprisingly philosophical worlds of bytebeats,
            generative image-making, and Unicode-art.
            By the end, participants were wondering why they ever relied on software to do things for them, and uninstall
            chatGPT forever!!!

            By Artist/Researcher Terence Broad, the talk includes new ways of understanding and engaging critically
            with AI within creative practice.<br>
            This talk showed how practices that treat AI as a material, rather than a tool or creative agent,
            artists were able to make critical works that presented new ways of understanding and making sense of these
            unfathomably complex computational systems. <br>

            A flâneur's guide to mapping the new geographies of connection. Contemplating on internet and

            the other. In so doing, they passed through various forms of physical and digital infrastructures that

            open
            source) node-based live coding language for building things with WebGL.
            Participants learned how to manipulate live and pre-recorded moving images, how to
            create and modify simple video effects, and how to interact with them through various I/O,
            then combine what they had learnt to make something unique </p>

            An evening of computational, experimental, and artist-led short films that bend narrative, fracture
            reality, and play at the edges of code, image, and memory. These works push the medium through
            storytelling, inventive editing, and striking visual languages.

            The closing event of "Does Cloud Compute (ever) Precipitate?" featured a panel discussion
            with participating artists and curators. Attendees reflected on the themes explored throughout the exhibition,
            shared insights, and engaged in a lively conversation about the future of technology, art, and our
            relationship with the cloud.
