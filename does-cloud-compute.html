            The Phreaking Collective invites you to <em>Does Cloud Compute (ever) Precipitate?</em> - An exhibition that
            asks a question and tells a poem. If clouds in nature condense and return as rain, can the digital cloud
            ever give back what it takes? Can data come home to the people who made it?

            <p>
              This show explores the hidden infrastructures that shape our lives, bringing materiality to the ethereal.
              It
              explores our relationship with the monoliths that are waking up, the environmental strain, the invisible
              human labour, and the worries of pooled resources in an unreturning atmosphere. Working across
              installations, sound works, generative systems and computational artwork, the exhibition examines the
              quiet
              romance in technological convenience.</p>

            <p>The Cloud, an unseen network of servers, energy and labour - is made tangible, visible and audible.The
              works confront the vast systems that silently maintain our lives, datacenters that feed on our energy and
              attention and the dependent relationship we have, the systems behind each upload, generation and stream.
            </p>

            <p> Running alongside the two week show is a series of talks, workshops, discussions, film screenings and
              performances where visitors are invited to look deeper into the unsung systems shaping our lives, and
              reflect on the strange romance and hidden dependencies that define our connection to the cloud.

              A web-based performance exploring climate modelling through digital aesthetics and architectural thinking.
              Moving between early numerical forecasting and contemporary synthetic intelligence, Counter-Modelling challenges the aesthetics of computational realism, presenting climate prediction as a site of tension between technological development and climate futures, shaped by power, uncertainty, and abstraction.<br>
              Lucia Rebolino is an artist, architect, and computational designer weaving science and art into counter-cartography, data, and web-based aesthetics. She is a researcher with Forensic Architecture in London, focusing on environmental justice investigations. Her work on prediction and climate models has been featured in e-flux and exhibited at the 2025 Venice Architecture Biennale. Her research-based artistic practice explores technology-driven screen performances, and she has lectured at cultural and academic institutions including MoMA, MediaLab Matadero, Columbia University, the Royal College of Art, and ETH Zurich.

              A Chengdu-born, London-based computational artist whose practice spans interactive installations,

            <p>
              Xach Hill is British-Kiwi transmedia artist, curator and creative technologist working across sculpture,
              code, and poetry. He explores the entanglement of human memory and machine logic, often using AI, LED
              matrices, and hacked hardware to question what it means to be seen, remembered, or misinterpreted by a
              system. Rooted in both computational poetics and glitch aesthetics, his work invites audiences into spaces
              where identity, intimacy, and error co-exist.

            <h3>Phoenix Isla Kea </h3>
            <p>
              Phoenix Isla Kea (b. 2003) is a London-born Polynesian artist working with computation, sound, and
              installation. With a background in photography and film, her current practice explores the psychological
              and
              emotional textures of online life, particularly the aesthetics of seduction, digital exploitation, and
              algorithmic control.
              Blending technical systems with embodied inquiry - Kea builds web environments, manipulates found media,
              and
              composes machinic forms shaped as much by emotional intensity - rage, longing, obsession, as by logic.
              Her research interrogates girlhood as a tactical identity, and the feedback loops between visibility,
              desire,
              and control in algorithmic culture.

            <h3>Nikos Antonio Kourous Vázquez</h3>
            <p>
              My work stems from a desire to challenge and expand prevailing narratives around machine learning: what it
              is,
              how it functions, and how it might evolve. As ‘machine learning' becomes the mythologized term ‘artificial
              intelligence,' as user-machine relationships become engraved, and as companies scramble to innovate and
              incorporate it, I feel compelled to create space for the technology to define itself.

            <p>
              My practice emerges from the intersection of software engineering and
              artistic research. I explore technological systems not as innovative tools
              but as powerful infrastructures that shape human identity, behavior, and
              our public space. By translating this critical inquiry into installations
              and code-based works, I reveal how technology restructures our human
              experience and reconstructs our ethical perception.
